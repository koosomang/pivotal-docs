# Continuous build / distribution (CI / CD) related terms
1. control plane: A set of tools for automated management of multiple platforms deployed and operating in the cloud (Pivotal Cloud Foundry Platform, MySQL Platform, Pivotal Ops Manager, etc.). It mainly includes Jumpbox (work VM), concourse (CI / CD tool.course-ci.org), docker registry, S3 and git repo as needed.
https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/refarch/azure/azure_ref_arch.html#refarchs
2. CI / CD Pipeline: An automated workflow from the build-to-deployment stage of the software to a concourse or jenkins.
3. concourse: An open source persistent build / persistent distribution (CI / CD) tool created by Pivotal. The pipeline is managed as source code, so you can instantly create pipelines and manage change history anytime and anywhere. concourse-ci.org
4. jumpBox: A VM that acts as a single access point for the platform(PAS, Control-Plane) . http://bosh.io/docs/terminology/#jumpbox
5. BOSH: An open source tool for the development, deployment, and operation of large-scale distributed clusters utilizing the cloud. Key features include: 1) Directly control creation, deletion, and modification of resources such as VM, Disk, and Network through CPI (Cloud Provider Interface) provided by IaaS providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, vmware and openstack Therefore, provisioning the cluster directly. 2) You can create a distribution of the software (platform package) that constitutes the cluster(BOSH release). http://bosh.io
6. BBL: Abbreviation of Bosh BootLoader, CLI tool for automatic network creation through jumpbox, bosh, terraform https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader
7. credhub: An open source encrypted repository tool created by pivotal. It is a key-value repository that can generate, store, and retrieve certificates, passwords, and so on. Concatenation with UAA (concourse, PAS) Stores authentication information managed by UAA to enhance security of platform data. You can enhance security by storing authentication information in conjunction with the developer's application. https://github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-release

# Pivotal Cloud Foundry related terms

1. PCF Foundation: A cluster in which Pivotal Ops Manager (BOSH) is deployed to automate and manage the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform. The PCF foundation is automatically installed and upgraded by the concourse pipeline.
2. Droplet: A name that refers to a container image for an application that is automatically generated inside PAS (Pivotal Application Service). It is automatically generated when an application is deployed using the cloud foundry command tool. cf push (http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/push.html)
If the application's executable code (jar file for java, source code for python) is thrown to the platform, then the JVM and framework required for the application execution in Java can be called from within the PaaS platform, . Even if one of the components such as JVM, framework, and application is changed due to security patches etc., it can be reassembled at any time, so automation efficiency is improved and container image is automatically managed by the platform, .
3. domains: The service domain to be used by applications served on PAS (Pivotal Application Service), ex) shared-domain.example.com
Applications are automatically published and sub-domains are published. ex) myapp.shared-domain.example.com
4. managed service: A service provided by a third party that the user can use as a self-service through Pivotal Cloud Foundry's API
5. orgs: The logical space in which the development team can develop and deploy applications on the Pivotal Application Service (PAS), often mapped to organizational structures such as teams that co-develop services.
6. routes: A service address that is assigned to the sub-domain in domains and bound to the application. In a PAS (Pivotal Application Service), an application can have multiple routes and be self-serviceable. ex) myapp.shared-domain.example.com
7. service: A backend service that can be used by applications such as MySQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ. It is exposed to marketplace on PAS (Pivotal Application Service) and can create service instance with self-service. These services are created by bosh-release and are managed by the platform administrator.
8. service instance: An instance created from service. There are two self-service models: MySQL for PCF can create self-service-only schemas, users, and self-service independent MySQL clusters in a public MySQL cluster pre-built by the operator .
9. UAA: One of cloud foundry's projects, it is responsible for user authentication based on OAuth2 protocol (User Account Authentication)
