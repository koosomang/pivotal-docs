In [Control Plane Architecture](control-plane.md) , security topics are scattered and it is hard to understand the relationship among each areas. this document covers all security topics in one place and helps to understand overall concepts.

# security assessment
- NIST(National Institue of standard and Technology): https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53
- Assessment of Pivotal Cloud Foundry against NIST SP 800-53(r4) Controls: https://docs.pivotal.io/nist/ca/ca-2.html
- NIST CA-2 SECURITY ASSESSMENTS: https://docs.pivotal.io/nist/ca/ca-2.html
- NIST CA-8 PENETRATION TESTING: https://docs.pivotal.io/nist/ca/ca-8.html

# Overall security in reference architecture 
* overall architure(TBD): access boundary, uaa topology, isolation segments

* Understanding Cloud Foundry Security(isolation segments in PAS): https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/concepts/security.html



# User management & integration
* UAA concept: https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/uaa/uaa-overview.html
* user management on PAS: 
- using uaac: https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/uaa/uaa-user-management.html
- using cf cli: https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/adminguide/cli-user-management.html
* user management on opsmanager https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/opsman-users.html
* user management on concourse https://docs.pivotal.io/p-concourse/4-x/authenticating.html
* user management on credhub with UAA: http://credhub-api.cfapps.io/version/2.1/#authentication
* hands on (TBD)

# Credhub & UAA integration
* co-locate credhub with concourse(web) https://github.com/myminseok/pivotal-docs/blob/master/concourse-with-credhub.md
* concourse with PAS auth https://github.com/myminseok/pivotal-docs/blob/master/concourse_with_cf_auth.md
* credhub co-location with bosh, credhub cluster https://github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-release/tree/master/docs

# Networking 
* understanding container to container networking with app service discovery( internal domains): https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/concepts/understand-cf-networking.html
* (reference) vxlan, overlay network( concept & diagram)  :http://blog.nigelpoulton.com/demystifying-docker-overlay-networking/
